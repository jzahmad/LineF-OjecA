### Description
The script controls the Thymio II robotâ€™s movement based on button presses and proximity sensor readings. It alternates the robot's direction based on proximity sensor input and uses a timer to adjust motor speeds periodically. The robot moves forward when the forward button is pressed, stops when the backward button is pressed, and adjusts its direction to avoid obstacles or navigate based on proximity sensor readings.
